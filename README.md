# Question-Answering-with-Transformers
Built an extractive Question Answering system using SQuAD v1.1 with fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT). Implemented evaluation via Exact Match &amp; F1, compared model performance, and developed an interactive Streamlit app with Ngrok for real-time QA.
